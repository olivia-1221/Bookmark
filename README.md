**What will the application do?** Allow users to log books theyâ€™ve read (title, author, date completed), store favorite 
quotes and bestow each entry with a rating. 

**Who will use it?** Any reader who wishes!

**Why is this a project of interest?** I love books and think itâ€™d be nice to create a logging application thatâ€™s 
simple, expressive, and easy to use.
